I have recently discovered uv for python and want to make use of it to its fullest extent. I am still learning what it is fully capable of, however, this python project should always use uv where it is the best option to do so. For example:

- Installing packages should be done using uv pip instead of just pip.
- Creating or managing virtual environments should be done using uv or uv venv.
- Any other area where uv excels as the better option over other standard/slower/outdated python/pip alternatives.
