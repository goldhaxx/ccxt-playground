# CCXT Playground

A sandbox environment for exploring and experimenting with the CCXT (Cryptocurrency Exchange Trading Library) Python implementation.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to test and allow users to play around with the CCXT Python library to get a better understanding of how each of the components of the library work. This repository serves as a learning ground where various scripts and use-cases are developed to:

- Explore CCXT library functionality
- Test different exchange integrations
- Document practical examples
- Address knowledge gaps through hands-on experimentation

## Project Structure

As gaps in knowledge emerge from other projects, new scripts and examples will be added to this repository. Each addition will focus on specific use-cases and implementations of the CCXT library.

## Purpose

This repository aims to:
1. Provide practical examples of CCXT usage
2. Serve as a reference for common cryptocurrency exchange operations
3. Document solutions to specific challenges encountered while working with CCXT
4. Create a collection of reusable code snippets for crypto exchange interactions

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute your own examples or suggest new use-cases that could benefit others learning CCXT.
